HELP_MESSAGE = '''CampusBot is a chatbot that has been built to collect data from students of TU Delft for experimental purposes. It consists of four different domains namely: *Food*, *Place*, *Courses* and *TrashBin*.

1. /food - Share a picture of your meal and also assess and identify items in other pictures.
2. /place - Upload information about several types of places on the TU Delft campus, for example, a study space, a lecture room or a parking space. Also add more information and validate an existing place.
3. /course - Learn and let learn, post any question related to a course at TU Delft, answer a question posted by a fellow student or vote existing answers.
4. /trashbin - Tide‚Äôs In- Dirt‚Äôs Out: Find trash bins on campus, add detailed information about them and also report the current trash level.

Each of these domains has two kinds of tasks:
- *Enrich*: you would be presented with a picture and asked to add detailed information about it.
- *Validate*: you would be asked to assess the already available information.

You can also *Create* a new item in each domain.

_Please note that the data would only be used for experimental purposes and your personal data would not be disclosed anywhere._
